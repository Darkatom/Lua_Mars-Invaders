Lua_Mars-Invaders
=============
Mars Invaders game was programmed with Lua and LÖVE2D 0.8.0 library following the iterative development model.
I programmed it with the intention of teaching others how to program in Lua and LÖVE2D while having fun with it.

<i>NOTE: The game is finished as of now, being Iteration 6 the one to hold the finished program.</i>

Controls
-----------------------------------------------------
Left Arrow - a: Move player to the left<br/>
Right Arrow - d: Move it to the right<br/> 
Return - z: Shoot<br/>


How to use it
-----------------------------------------------------
Each iteration holds the code for what was developed during that iteration. This means, each one of them holds a copy of the game during various stages. As of now, the game is finished. You can find it completed inside the "Iteration 6" folder.

The only thing you need is [LÖVE2D](http://love2d.org/). Just download the v.0.8.0 and follow the steps.
To execute it, click and drag the root folder of the game to the LÖVE2D.exe icon. If this does not work, check [LÖVE2D webpage](http://love2d.org/) for other methods.
<i>NOTE: Newer versions might not work properly for this game.</i>
